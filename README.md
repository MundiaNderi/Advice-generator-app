![Design preview for the Advice generator app coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

Was to build out this advice generator app using the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

## Deployed project

The website is hosted on netlify: https://heroic-starlight-3cb0b0.netlify.app
